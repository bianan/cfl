This repository contains the code for simulating federated learning experiments in the
Continual Federated Learning (CFL) setting.

It implements a simulation system using TensorFlow low-level APIs. The main files are:

- "contiunal-fl.py” : defines the main APIs for the CFL setting
- "word_lstm_model.py”: defines the APIs for a word-level LSTM model
- “linear_model.py”: defines the APIs for a simple 1-D linear regression model
- “utils.py”: defines the utility functions for the CFL setting
